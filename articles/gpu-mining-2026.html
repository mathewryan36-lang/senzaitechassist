  <h2>Is GPU Mining Still Worth It in 2026?</h2>
  <p><em>Published: December 2025 | Author: Lucius Prime</em></p>

  <p>
    GPU mining has gone through major shifts post-Ethereum. But in 2026, it’s far from dead.
    While competition is fierce and electricity rates play a critical role, there are still
    real profits to be made — if you know where to look.
  </p>

  <h3>What Coins Can You Still Mine?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Kaspa (KAS):</strong> One of the fastest PoW blockchains — still profitable for solo miners with GPUs.</li>
    <li><strong>Ergo (ERG):</strong> Smart contract-capable and eco-conscious. Low difficulty, decent returns.</li>
    <li><strong>Neoxa (NEOX):</strong> A GPU-friendly blockchain built for gaming/metaverse integration.</li>
    <li><strong>Radiant (RXD):</strong> Growing fast. Optimized for GPU miners with a strong community.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Recommended Hardware for 2026</h3>
  <p>
    While older cards like the RTX 3060 Ti still perform well on select coins, newer models offer
    better efficiency. Here are our top picks:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>RTX 4070 Ti SUPER:</strong> Best value/performance balance for small-to-mid farms.</li>
    <li><strong>RX 7900 XTX:</strong> AMD’s flagship still holding strong for Kaspa and ERG.</li>
    <li><strong>Used RTX 3080s:</strong> Secondary market deals are ideal for budget miners.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Mining Profitability in 2026</h3>
  <p>
    Profit margins are tighter — but with cheap electricity or solar setups, it's still viable.
    For solo miners, it’s more about long-term stacking than short-term flipping.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use profitability calculators like <a href="https://whattomine.com" target="_blank">WhatToMine</a>
    to adjust expectations based on current hash rates and difficulty.
  </p>

  <h3>Future-Proof Your Mining Rig</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use open-air rigs or server chassis for better airflow and thermal control.</li>
    <li>Keep your BIOS + drivers updated for efficiency boosts.</li>
    <li>Explore merged mining and multi-coin switching software like HiveOS or RaveOS.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    GPU mining in 2026 isn’t dead — but it’s evolved. Smart miners focus on efficiency,
    long-term holdings, and hybrid setups. At Senzai Tech Assist, we’re still running test rigs
    and stacking where it makes sense.
